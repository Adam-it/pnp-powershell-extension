# PnP PowerShell extension

This extension provides functionalities that may be helpful when creating scripts using PnP PowerShell. Currently the extension provides:

- docs viewer inside VS Code
- samples gallery
- snippets with all possible commands

Please check [PnP PowerShell docs](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/) for more information.

## âœ¨ Features

### Script samples gallery

Using `PnP PS: Open samples gallery` command, or 'Samples' button from the controls above the command list, you may open the gallery with all available samples. Currently the samples shown are retrieved from the [PnP script samples repository](https://github.com/pnp/script-samples). From the samples gallery you may go to the sample location or create a new tab (file) in the editor prefilled with the PnP PowerShell script. It is possible to search for sample by:

- title
- authors
- commands used in samples

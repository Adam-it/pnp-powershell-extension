## âœ¨ Features

### Script samples gallery

Using `PnP PS: Open samples gallery` command, or 'Samples' button, you may open the gallery with all available samples. Currently the samples shown are retrieved from the [PnP script samples repository](https://github.com/pnp/script-samples). From the samples gallery you may go to the sample location or create a new tab in editor prefilled with the PnP PowerShell script.  It is possible to search for sample by:

- title
- authors
- commands used in samples
